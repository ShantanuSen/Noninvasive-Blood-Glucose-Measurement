# Noninvasive-Blood-Glucose-Measurement

In-Vivo Estimation of Glucose Level Using PPG Signal

Abstract - Despite being at the start of the 21st-century, the non-invasive measurement of blood glucose still remains a challenging task in the scientific world. In recent times, several studies have been carried out based on the optical properties of light to measure the changes in blood volume and tried to calculate various physiological parameters including blood glucose using PPG signal. In our study, we try to develop a non-invasive method for blood glucose estimation by transmissive and reflective PPG signals of the subjects. We also develop a hardware system to collect PPG. In our proposed method, we accurately relate the features that are obtained from PPG to the original blood glucose values from a glucometer. Our proposed methodology has maximum correlation value of 0.91.
